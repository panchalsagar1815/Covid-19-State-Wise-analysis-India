Project Title: COVID-19 State-Wise Analysis - India

Project Description:
The "COVID-19 State-Wise Analysis - India" project is a comprehensive examination of the pandemic's impact across different states and union territories in India. The project incorporates key features including State/UTs, Total Cases, Active Cases, Discharged Cases, Deaths, Active Ratio (%), Discharge Ratio (%), and Death Ratio (%).

This analysis aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the varying dynamics of COVID-19 within different regions of India. By meticulously studying the total cases, active cases, recoveries, and mortality rates, the project seeks to identify patterns and trends that can assist healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public in making informed decisions.

Utilizing statistical methods and data visualization techniques, the project will highlight the active ratio, discharge ratio, and death ratio, offering insights into the severity and recovery rates in each state and union territory. The findings may contribute to targeted interventions, resource allocation, and public health strategies tailored to the specific needs of each region.

Through this project, we aim to contribute valuable information to the ongoing efforts in managing and mitigating the impact of COVID-19, facilitating a more informed and data-driven approach in the battle against the pandemic at the regional level in India.
